# NOTE: authorized_groups and authorized_users control two things independently:
#
# 1. Does the SSO Dashboard display a tile to the user for this application?
#
#        No, if display: false.
#            No SSO users can see the tile.
#
#        Maybe, if display: true.
#            If groups/users are defined,
#                The user must be a member of them to see the tile.
#            Otherwise,
#                All SSO users (including the general public) can see the tile.
#
# 2. Does Auth0 restrict SSO access to this application by group or user?
#
#        No, if client_id is missing.
#            All SSO users (including the general public) can access the app.
#
#        Maybe, if client_id is defined.
#            If groups/users are defined,
#                The user must be a member of them to access the application.
#            Otherwise,
#                All SSO users (including the general public) can access the app.
